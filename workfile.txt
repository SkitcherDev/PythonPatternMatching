The isPhoneNumber() function has code that does several checks to see whether the string in text is a valid phone number. If any of these checks fail, the function returns False. First the code checks that the string is exactly 12 characters . Then it checks that the area code (that is, the first three characters in text) consists of only numeric characters . The rest of the function checks that the string follows the pattern of a phone number: The number must have the first hyphen after the area code , three more numeric characters, then another hyphen , and finally four more numbers. If the program execution manages to get past all the checks, it returns True .
Calling isPhoneNumber() with the argument '415-555-4242' will return True. Calling isPhoneNumber() with 'Moshi moshi' will return False; the first test fails because 'Moshi moshi' is not 12 characters long.
You would have to add even more code to find this pattern of text in a 415-531-4112'. Replace the last four print() function calls in isPhoneNumber.py with the following: quirijnvdmark@gmail.com
